GitHub backup script - in Bourne shell.

This is a port of clockfort's GitHub-Backup script to Bourne shell.

I would have used the above but Perl still does not ship with LWP.

I almost started writing a Python script since Python does ship both
a JSON parser and urllib in the standard library, but luckily a closer
examination of GitHub-Backup revealed that the YAML format is very
parseable by shell code.

This script uses curl which git requires, therefore it has no dependencies
beyond those needed by git.

This code is released in the public domain.
